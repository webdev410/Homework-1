# Homework-1
This is the first homework submission of the JHU Coding Bootcamp by Andrew Keiser. It is a website for a fake SEO company.

## Objective
The goal was to refactor the code on the site without changing the appearance. Refactoring included replacing div tags with semantic tags, combining the CSS and commenting as well.
